# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the art of using principles,methods and tools to design ,develop ,test and maintain software systems
importance in technology industry is that it enables creation of software application and sytems that powers a crucial role in the heathcare system,entertainment,commerce and communication


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the term software engineering was coined during the NATO software engineering conference in germisch,germany,in 1968
The conference was pivotal in addressing software crisis where the complexity of software development was outpacing the ability to manage it effectively
INTRODUCTION to object oriented proggramming language-introduced a paradigm shift from procedural proggramming
The agile manifestation -emphasized iterative development collaboration and responsiveness to change.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement gathering and analysis-involves collecting and documenting needs and expectations of stakeholders
2.System Analysis-the requirements are translated into a detailed system architecture and design
3.Implementation-this phase involves the actual development of the software,,,developers write the code based on the design spesification,imlementing the systems functionality
4.Testing-focuses on identifying and fixing defects and verifing that the software meets the requirements specified earlier

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions and instructions in a specific and concise manner to assist an AI tool to give the desired results


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
EXAMPLE  explain programming language  instead explain c++ as a programming language
